-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embarked on a transformative learning journey with our project: Basic Encryption and Decryption Application. We scratched the surface of the Java AWT framework, learnt the foundation of GUI development, and studied fundamental event handling techniques.
Guided by Java documentation and insightful blog posts, we paved our path towards understanding the intricacies of Java programming, not relying on tutorials but embracing self-driven exploration.
The incorporation of a substitution cipher into our application elevated our understanding of data security and encryption. We're not just building software; we're laying the foundation for robust security practices.
As a prototype, our application may stumble and encounter occasional hiccups - all part of the learning process. These 'imperfections' serve as stepping stones for improvement, embodying the iterative nature of our journey.
Throughout this project, we encountered challenges and embraced them as opportunities. Debugging became a puzzle to solve, and every obstacle was a chance to refine our problem-solving skills.
